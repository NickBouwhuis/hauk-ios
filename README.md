# Hauk iOS client

Based on [the original Hauk](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk) by Github user bilde2910

## What is this?

This is an iOS client for the Hauk app. An open-source location sharing platform. With self-hosted server.

That means your location is only being shared with your own server and who you share the URL with.

## Todo

The app currently lacks some features the original Android app has, mainly

- [ ] Password protected shares
- [ ] Creating a group
- [ ] Participating in a group
- [ ] Set sharing duration from Shortcut action (currently hardcoded to 1h)

Please do open PRs for this!

## How do I get it?
[Get it on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/hauk/id6738009304?l=en-GB)
