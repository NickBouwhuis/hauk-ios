# Hauk iOS client

Based on [the original Hauk](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk) by Github user bilde2910

## What is this?

This is an iOS client for the Hauk app. An open-source location sharing platform. With self-hosted server.

That means your location is only being shared with your own server and who you share the URL with.

## Todo

The app currently lacks some features the original Android app has, mainly

- [ ] Password protected shares
- [ ] Creating a group
- [ ] Participating in a group

Please do open PRs for this!

## How do I get it?
I currently do not pay for an Apple Developer Program license since I am not a seasoned iOS developer (this is the first time I have written an iOS app).

The only way to run it on your phone currently is to get Xcode and build the source code yourself.
